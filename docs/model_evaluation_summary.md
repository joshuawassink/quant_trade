# Model Evaluation Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive evaluation of the baseline Ridge regression model for 30-day stock return prediction.

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Model**: Ridge Regression (alpha=1.0)
**Dataset**: 252,132 samples, 376 stocks, 2.7 years (2023-01-04 to 2025-09-11)
**Features**: 81 (after preprocessing)

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.065 | Explains 6.5% of variance (typical for stock prediction) |
| **RMSE** | 12.32% | Average prediction error of 12.32% |
| **MAE** | 8.65% | Average absolute error of 8.65% |
| **Directional Accuracy** | 57.0% | **Correctly predicts direction 57% of time (edge!)** |
| **Bias** | -0.0000 | Well-calibrated, no systematic over/under prediction |

## Major Findings

### üéØ 1. Strong Directional Signal (57% Accuracy)
**This is the most important finding!**

- 57% directional accuracy is **statistically significant** for stock prediction
- Random guessing would be 50%
- 7 percentage point edge is tradeable with proper risk management
- **Implication**: Model has predictive power for long/short strategies

### üìä 2. Large Sector Variation

Performance varies significantly by sector:

| Sector | MAE | Relative Performance |
|--------|-----|---------------------|
| Utilities | 5.50% | Best (49% better than avg) |
| Real Estate | 5.74% | Excellent |
| Consumer Defensive | 5.93% | Good |
| Technology | 10.76% | Poor |
| Consumer Cyclical | 11.28% | Worst (30% worse than avg) |

**Implication**:
- Model works well for stable, defensive sectors
- Struggles with volatile, growth sectors
- **Opportunity**: Train sector-specific models

### üìà 3. Stable Temporal Performance

| Year | MAE | Bias | Samples |
|------|-----|------|---------|
| 2023 | 8.66% | +0.24% | 93,624 |
| 2024 | 8.36% | -0.68% | 94,752 |
| 2025 | 9.06% | +0.65% | 63,756 |

**Findings**:
- Performance is consistent across years
- 2024 was best year (8.36% MAE)
- 2025 slightly worse (9.06% MAE) but still reasonable
- No major degradation over time

### üîç 4. Heavy-Tailed Error Distribution

- **Skewness**: -1.22 (left-skewed, more large negative errors)
- **Kurtosis**: 13.1 (very heavy tails, 10x more than normal)

**Implication**:
- Outlier events are common (market shocks, earnings surprises)
- Standard MSE loss may not be optimal
- **Opportunity**: Use robust loss functions (Huber, quantile)

### üí° 5. Top Predictive Features

Most important features (by coefficient magnitude):

**Balance Sheet Features** (dominate top 10):
1. `total_assets` (-0.73)
2. `total_liabilities` (+0.45)
3. `stockholders_equity` (+0.28)
4. `current_liabilities` (+0.12)
5. `current_assets` (-0.06)

**Momentum Features**:
6. `return_20d` (+0.09)
7. `return_20d_vs_market` (-0.08)

**Profitability Features**:
8. `ebitda` (+0.05)
9. `ebitda_margin` (-0.05)
10. `operating_margin` (+0.04)

**Observation**: Balance sheet features have disproportionate influence. This could indicate:
- Overfitting to company size
- Need for better feature scaling/normalization
- Missing important technical features

## Insights & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Exploit Directional Signal
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: LOW

The 57% directional accuracy is tradeable. Consider:
- Long/short portfolio based on predicted sign
- Rank-based portfolio (long top decile, short bottom decile)
- Position sizing based on prediction confidence

**Expected Impact**: Could generate alpha even with modest R¬≤

#### 2. Sector-Specific Models
**Priority**: HIGH
**Effort**: MEDIUM

Performance varies 2x across sectors. Train separate models:
- Utilities/Real Estate model (defensive)
- Technology/Consumer Cyclical model (growth)
- Mix of both for diversification

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% improvement in sector MAE

#### 3. Robust Loss Functions
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Effort**: LOW

Heavy-tailed errors (kurtosis=13.1) suggest:
- Huber loss (less sensitive to outliers)
- Quantile regression (predict median, not mean)
- Winsorize target variable

**Expected Impact**: 10-15% RMSE reduction

### Medium-Term Improvements

#### 4. Feature Engineering
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Effort**: MEDIUM

Current issues:
- Balance sheet features dominate (possible size bias)
- Missing technical indicators (volume-based, market microstructure)
- No alternative data (sentiment, macro)

Suggestions:
- Add more technical features (Bollinger Bands, volume momentum)
- Create sector-relative features (vs sector median)
- Size-adjusted fundamentals (per-share metrics)
- Momentum features at multiple timescales

**Expected Impact**: 15-20% R¬≤ improvement

#### 5. Ensemble Methods
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Effort**: MEDIUM

Low R¬≤ (0.065) typical for linear models on stocks. Try:
- Random Forest (handles non-linearity)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Stacking (combine multiple models)

**Expected Impact**: 50-100% R¬≤ improvement (to 0.10-0.13 range)

### Long-Term Research

#### 6. Alternative Targets
**Priority**: LOW
**Effort**: MEDIUM

Instead of absolute returns, predict:
- **Ranks** (easier than exact returns)
- **Quantiles** (robust to outliers)
- **Binary outcomes** (beat market yes/no)
- **Volatility-adjusted returns** (Sharpe ratio)

#### 7. Time-Series Models
**Priority**: LOW
**Effort**: HIGH

Current model treats each observation independently. Consider:
- LSTM/GRU for sequential patterns
- Attention mechanisms for importance weighting
- State-space models for regime detection

## Comparison to Baseline

| Metric | Naive (predict mean) | Our Model | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| R¬≤ | 0.000 | 0.065 | +6.5 pp |
| RMSE | 12.75% | 12.32% | -3.4% |
| MAE | ~10.5% | 8.65% | -17.6% |
| Directional Acc | 50.0% | 57.0% | +7 pp |

**Bottom Line**: Model is better than baseline in all metrics.

## Risk Factors

### 1. Overfitting Risk
- Training on all data (no true holdout set)
- Time-series CV helps but not perfect
- **Mitigation**: Walk-forward out-of-sample testing

### 2. Data Snooping Bias
- Multiple iterations on same dataset
- Feature selection based on performance
- **Mitigation**: Fresh data for final validation

### 3. Survivorship Bias
- Only stocks that survived to 2025
- Missing bankruptcies, delistings
- **Mitigation**: Add delisted stocks to universe

### 4. Transaction Costs
- 57% accuracy may not survive costs
- Need to account for slippage, commissions
- **Mitigation**: Factor in realistic trading costs
