# TODO: Model Improvements

Systematic plan to improve baseline Ridge regression model based on evaluation insights.

## Current Performance
- RÂ²: 0.065
- MAE: 8.65%
- RMSE: 12.32%
- Directional Accuracy: 57.0%
- **Problem**: Error skew = -1.22 (underestimates big positive moves)

---

## Phase 1: Baseline Linear Model Improvements (Current Focus)

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Negative Skew

#### 1.1 Address Underestimation of Positive Swings
**Problem**: Skew = -1.22 means model misses big positive moves

**Root Causes to Investigate**:
- [ ] Target variable distribution (is it skewed?)
- [ ] Feature clipping (are we removing positive outliers?)
- [ ] Ridge penalty (is L2 shrinking predictions too much?)
- [ ] Training on log-returns vs raw returns

**Solutions to Try**:
- [ ] **Log-transform target** for heavy-tailed distribution
  - File: `scripts/create_training_dataset.py`
  - Change: Apply `log(1 + return)` transform

- [ ] **Asymmetric loss function** (penalize underestimation more)
  - File: `scripts/train_baseline_model.py`
  - Use: `sklearn.linear_model.QuantileRegressor` (75th percentile)

- [ ] **Adjust outlier clipping** (keep more positive outliers)
  - File: `src/models/preprocessing.py`
  - Change: Asymmetric percentiles (0.5, 99.5 instead of 0.1, 99.9)

- [ ] **Post-prediction adjustment** (shift predictions by median error)
  - File: `scripts/train_baseline_model.py`
  - Add: Bias correction term

**Expected Impact**: Reduce skew to <|0.5|, improve capture of big winners

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Feature Engineering

#### 1.2 Add Technical Indicators (Address Balance Sheet Bias)
**Problem**: Top features are all balance sheet (size metrics), missing momentum

**Features to Add**:
- [ ] **Bollinger Bands**
  - `bb_upper`, `bb_lower`, `bb_width`, `price_bb_position`

- [ ] **Volume-based**
  - `volume_sma_ratio` (volume / 20-day avg)
  - `obv` (On-Balance Volume)
  - `volume_price_trend`

- [ ] **Market microstructure**
  - `bid_ask_spread` (if available)
  - `intraday_range` (high - low)
  - `close_position` ((close - low) / (high - low))

- [ ] **Additional momentum**
  - `momentum_6m`, `momentum_9m`, `momentum_12m`
  - `returns_consistency` (% of positive days in last 20)

**File**: `src/features/technical.py`
**Expected Impact**: 10-15% MAE improvement

#### 1.3 Sector-Relative Features
**Problem**: Tech stocks have 11% MAE vs Utilities 5.5% MAE

**Features to Add**:
- [ ] `return_vs_sector` (performance vs sector median)
- [ ] `pe_ratio_vs_sector`
- [ ] `revenue_growth_vs_sector`
- [ ] `volatility_vs_sector`

**File**: `src/features/fundamental.py`
**Expected Impact**: Reduce sector MAE variation by 30%

#### 1.4 Size-Adjusted Fundamentals
**Problem**: `total_assets` has coefficient -0.73 (size bias)

**Features to Replace**:
- [ ] Replace `total_revenue` â†’ `revenue_per_share`
- [ ] Replace `net_income` â†’ `eps` (earnings per share)
- [ ] Replace `total_assets` â†’ `book_value_per_share`
- [ ] Add `revenue_per_employee`
- [ ] Add `profit_margin_rank` (percentile vs all stocks)

**File**: `src/features/fundamental.py`
**Expected Impact**: Reduce size bias, improve small-cap performance

---

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - Hyperparameter Tuning

#### 1.5 Ridge Alpha Optimization
**Current**: Alpha = 1.0 (arbitrary)

**Approach**:
- [ ] Grid search: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, 1000]
- [ ] Use time-series CV for validation
- [ ] Plot validation RÂ² vs alpha (regularization path)

**File**: `scripts/train_baseline_model.py`
**Expected Impact**: 5-10% RÂ² improvement

#### 1.6 Feature Selection
**Problem**: Using all 81 features (some may be noise)

**Methods to Try**:
- [ ] **L1 regularization** (Lasso) for automatic selection
- [ ] **Recursive Feature Elimination** (RFE)
- [ ] **Correlation analysis** (remove highly correlated features)
- [ ] **Mutual information** (keep high MI features only)

**File**: New script `scripts/feature_selection.py`
**Expected Impact**: 5% MAE improvement, faster training

### ðŸ”µ ANALYSIS - Understand Current Model

#### 1.7 Detailed Error Analysis
- [ ] **Error by return magnitude**
  - Do we underestimate large moves more than small?

- [ ] **Error by volatility**
  - Performance on high-vol vs low-vol stocks

- [ ] **Error by market regime**
  - Bull market vs bear market performance

- [ ] **Error by time to earnings**
  - Performance near earnings announcements

**File**: `scripts/analyze_model_errors.py` (create)

#### 1.8 Feature Interaction Analysis
- [ ] Which features work together?
- [ ] Which features conflict?
- [ ] Are there polynomial features worth adding?

**File**: `scripts/analyze_feature_interactions.py` (create)

## Phase 2: Data Expansion (Future Work)

### 2.1 Expand Stock Universe
**Current**: 377 stocks (S&P 500 with data availability filter)

**Expansion Options**:
- [ ] **Full S&P 500** (all 500 stocks)
  - Challenge: More missing data for recent additions
  - Expected gain: +30% more training data

- [ ] **S&P 400 Mid-Cap**
  - Challenge: Different dynamics than large-cap
  - Expected gain: 2x training data

- [ ] **Russell 2000 Small-Cap**
  - Challenge: Much higher volatility, less fundamental data
  - Expected gain: 5x training data

**Recommendation**: Start with full S&P 500, then add mid-cap

### 2.2 Extend Historical Data
**Current**: 2023-01-04 to 2025-09-11 (2.7 years)

**Extension Options**:
- [ ] **Back to 2020** (include COVID period)

- [ ] **Insider trading** (Form 4 filings)
- [ ] **Short interest** (from FINRA)
- [ ] **Options data** (implied volatility, put/call ratio)

## Notes

- **Focus**: Iterate quickly, measure after each change
- **Baseline first**: Get linear model as good as possible before ensembles
- **Avoid overfitting**: Always use time-series CV, never optimize on full dataset
- **Document**: Update evaluation report after each major change
- **Version control**: Tag models (v1.0, v1.1, etc.) for comparison

## Questions to Answer

1. **Why do we underestimate positive moves?**
   - Is target distribution skewed?
   - Are features clipped asymmetrically?
   - Is Ridge penalty too strong?

2. **Why do balance sheet features dominate?**
   - Are they truly predictive or just size proxies?
   - Do we need more technical features?
   - Should we use sector-relative metrics?

3. **Can we exploit the 57% directional accuracy?**
   - Build long/short portfolio
   - Rank-based allocation
   - Option strategies

4. **What's the ceiling for linear models?**
   - Test on perfect features
   - Compare to ensemble baseline
   - When to graduate to non-linear models?
